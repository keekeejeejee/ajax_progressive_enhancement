# ajax_progressive_enhancement
A simple example of a signup form that uses JavaScript according to the principles of progressive enhancement to improve on the basic experience.

The basic experience is a static form, and unobtrusive JavaScript builds upon it to add a little validation and an ajax image upload that speeds things up by working while the user fills out the rest of the form.

Get the code, run `npm install`, and you're good.
